# UI Components project
  - I wanted to build most of the standard UI components, commonly used in web applications, such as Tabs, Accordion, ModalDialog, using React.
  - This repo is a collection of components build for practice and to expand my knowledge
  - There are lots of accessibility challenges that I stumbled upon and handled while building these components.
  - I have captured those learnings for each component & documented them inside respective component folder.

## Which components will be included:
  I have planned to include the following components (the list could grow if I find more exciting things to build):
  - `DataTable` component
  - `Tabs` component
  - `Accordion` component
  - `AuthCodeInput` (OTPInput) 
  - `ModalDialog`

## Notes:
  - I have also shared my solution approach for building the component and the lessons learned while building each component.

 1. `DataTable` component:
     - breakdown: `<HeaderRow>`, `<Row>`, `<SelectPageSize />`, `<Pagination>` smaller components 👇
